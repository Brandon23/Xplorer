A basic, open-source file-manager written in PHP.

Version 1.0.0
=======
  - Reading Directory & File Permissions
  - Listing Directories
  - Listing Files
  - Adding Folder's(mkdir) Coded, just need to implement it
  - Reading Directory & File Size still seems to be a bit wonky, if anyone could contribute to fixing this, that would be epic.
